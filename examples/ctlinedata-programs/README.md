# Example inversion dataset
This small and non-sensical example inversion output dataset *`example-inversion-output/inversion.output.dat`* is really just one line of AEM inversion results, with line 3001401 duplicated as line 4001401. It is used to demonstrating the ctlinedata programs. Thus the gridding results from *`ctlinedata2slicegrids.exe`* will not make sense because of it being one duplicated line.

The script *`example-inversion-output/splitlines.bat`* uses a utility program for splitting up ASCII datafiles by column number called *`splitasciibycolumn.exe`*. These are the files in the *`lines`* sub-directory. *`Splitasciibycolumn.exe`* can be found in the open-source GitHub repository [*utility-programs*](https://github.com/rcb547/utility-programs). The Windows executables are available [*here*](https://github.com/rcb547/utility-programs/releases/tag/v1.0).
